## Hello! 
<img src="/assets/img/Noel_Naughton.jpg" style="float: right;" width="200">

I am currently finishing my PhD in Mechanical Engieering at the University of Illinois and expect to graduate Fall 2019. I hail from the beautiful St. Paul, MN where I also completed my undergrad at the University of Saint Thomas. 

My current research focus is on computational modeling of skeletal muscle. In particular, I am working on predicting microstrucutral parameters of muscle using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) and on micro-mechanical modeling of how muscle microstructure affects mechancial properties of muscle. More broadly, I am interested in how computational models can be leveraged to solve inverse problems in a variety of situations. 

Please have a look around this website and feel free to contact me with any questions!
