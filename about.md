I am currently a Beckman Institute Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's Beckman Institute of Advanced Science and Technology where I am investigating how biological embodiment guides behavioral selection and control. I am also applying these insights to develop learning-based, neuromorphic control that translate the naturally evolved capabilities of compliant, biological creature to soft robotic applications.

Right now I am focused how this embodiment is manifested in the complex muscular architecture of an octopus arm. I am working with the [CyberOctopus](https://cyberoctopus.csl.illinois.edu/){: target="_blank"} project, which is developing a computational analog to living octopuses that can adapt, learn, and evolve to novel tasks, situations, and environments. We are developing models of octopus biomechanics and neuro-muscular control using [Elastica](https://cosseratrods.org){: target="_blank"}, which is a software package we are developing for numerical simulations of Cosserat rods. 

I earned my Ph.D. in [Mechanical Engineering](https://mechse.illinois.edu/){: target="_blank"} at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I was an NSF Graduate Fellow. There, I coupled high-performance computational modeling of diffusion-weighted MRI physics with machine learning-based, data-driven inverse models to non-invasively characterize the microstructural properties of skeletal muscle. 

I am originally from St. Paul, MN where I completed my undergrad at the [University of Saint Thomas](https://stthomas.edu){: target="_blank"}.

I am interested in how medical imaging (especially MRI) can be used to inform mechanical models of compliant fibrous structures. I believe such models will advance  musculoskeletal health and comparative biology applications while the insights gleaned will provide advanced design and control strategies for soft, compliant robots.
