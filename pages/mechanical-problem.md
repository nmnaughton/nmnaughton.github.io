Solving the [inverse problem](/pages/inverse-problem/) gives us estimates of the skeletal muscle's microstructure. We can use these estimates to investigate how changes in the microstructure affects the ability of the muscle to transmit force. Changes in the microstruture lead to changes in the mechancial properties of muscle and these mechancial properties influence how well force is transmited through the muscle. By creating micro-mechanical models of the microstructure, we can investigate how these effective properties are influenced by changes in the microstructure, not unsimilar to what we did with diffusion in the [forward problem](/pages/forward-problem/).
