Using the estimates of the skeletal muscle's microstruture from the solution of the [inverse problem](/pages/inverse-problem/), we can now investigate how changes in the microstruture effects the ability of the muscle to transmit force. It effects the muscle by changing the effective mechanical properties of the tissue. By creating micro-mechanical models of the microstruture, we can investigate how these effective properties are influences by changes in the microstruture, not unsimilar to what we did with diffusion in the [forward problem](/pages/forward-problem/). 

This is an area of my reserach that I am just starting so I do not yet have much to report, but I should have results soon!
