My current research focuses on measuring the microstructure of skeletal muscle. This will allow

This work can be broadly organized as three seperate but interrelated problems:

This is the numerical solution of the Bloch-Torrey equation.  We can look at how different structures lead to different dMRI measurments, both with histology and simplified muscle models. We use the lattice Boltzmann method to solve the BT equation. 

# Inverse Problem

How do we go from the dMRI signal to the underlying structure? This includes various modeling attempts such as response surfaces and machine learning. 
Image ideas: Difficult to create a graphical representation since this is mostly about predicting a single value, however, the idea of sensitivity to the signal might yield good visualization. 

# Mechanical Problem 

If we can predict microstructural information, then how does this help us understand the mechanics of muscle? We use a simple mechancial model to see which parameters most effect muscle properties. We also need to measure properties of the muscle.
