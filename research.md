My current postdoc research is focused on using Cosserat rod theory to model slender, 1-dimensional structures. In particular, I am working on the [CyberOctopus](https://cyberoctopus.csl.illinois.edu/){: target="_blank"} project where we are using these Cosserat rods to model the mechanics of octopus arms. The Gazzola lab has developed a numerical solver [Elastica](https://cosseratrods.org){: target="_blank"} which is used to perform this simulations. 

My PhD research was on computational modeling of skeletal muscle. I worked on predicting microstructural parameters of muscle using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) and on micro-mechanical modeling of how muscle microstructure affects mechanical properties of muscle.
