**Overview of research**

More of a landing page, will briefly describe the overall themes and goals and lay out the main research areas. Essentially explaining the below graphic (which I will probably remake with better images etc.). I will also embed the short video I am making here. This is the broader impacts part.

**Forward Problem**

This is the numerical solution of the Bloch-Torrey equation.  We can look at how different structures lead to different dMRI measurments, both with histology and simplified muscle models. We use the lattice Boltzmann method to solve the BT equation. 

**Inverse Problem**

How do we go from the dMRI signal to the underlying structure? This includes various modeling attempts such as response surfaces and machine learning. 
Image ideas: Difficult to create a graphical representation since this is mostly about predicting a single value, however, the idea of sensitivity to the signal might yield good visualization. 

**Mechanical Problem**

If we can predict microstructural information, then how does this help us understand the mechanics of muscle? We use a simple mechancial model to see which parameters most effect muscle properties. We also need to measure properties of the muscle.
